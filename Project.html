    <p>His eyes opened, greeted by the cloudless blue sky, eyes burning from the planets, two suns. The distant crash of waves can be heard with the occasional chatter of birds.

He lifts himself off the ground, his entire body feeling heavy. When he tries to walk, his legs give in making him look like a newborn deer. Strange, he thought and when he tries to lift himself up again his legs don’t give out but are still threatening to buckle.",

For a brief moment when the waves come in enough to see his reflection, he realises he doesn’t recognize it. How could I not know my own reflection? he thinks walking quickly to the water to get a better look at himself. He was tall, probably an entire head taller than the average man. His hair was a pure white reaching down to the middle of his back, covered in tangles and sand. The man was tanned and covered in white freckles shining like diamonds. The most peculiar thing about him was a large horn protruding from his forehead. It was a pale blue also covered in the shining specks.",

He stumbled back deciding to walk far away from the water so he couldn't see himself.After walking for a while he saw a village surrounded by hundreds of ships, both large and small. The closer he got the more the village seemed to grow. It started by the shore and traveled all the way into the distant mountains. Once he was inside the town he was surrounded by the most people he had ever seen ,which currently is zero.",

The further he walked down this street the more he realized how many eyes were on him. Whenever he turns to meet one of the villagers eyes, they turn away pretending he was never there. Maybe this is just how the local people act? He wondered to himself as he passes a window and sees his reflection. Oh yeah, the giant horn poking out of my head.",

When he turned he was greeted with a large group of men chasing after a younger man and woman.The young man quickly stopped and yelled, “Now!” The woman then turned and threw a small spherical object. The large group stopped in confusion, one of the members bent down to pick it up. As soon as his hand touched it, the ball exploded covering the street in a thick blue fog. When the smoke dissipated those two were gone. Leaving nothing except the smoke and the faint footprints to show they were even there. Follow them?",

They were loading a large chest onto a ship. The younger man notices his staring and approaches him.“You’re an odd looking one” He looks him up and down. “Sorry?” His voice was strained, as if he hadn’t used  it in a very long time. “Who’s this Claude?” The girl appears from inside him. The man, Claude, lightly punches her on the shoulder.“Rude” He whispers to her. Claude was shorter than him, with short black hair and dark piercing eyes. His  clothing was similar to those of a pirate and a feather on his ear. The girl was very short, about chest height on Claude. Her hair was curly brown held on top of her head with a ribbon. “So who are you and why were you staring at us?” Claude stares him dead in the eyes. “You were in the street fighting a group of men.” He states plainly.“Oh you saw that?”“Are you here to arrest us?”The girl says from behind him. “No?”He tilts his head in confusion.“Does he look like an officer Pippa?” The girl, Pippa, frowns.“You never know!”“I’m not an officer.” “See?”Claude says to her. “Anyway, who are you?”",
